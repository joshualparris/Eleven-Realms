# Eleven Realms: Game Design Roadmap

## Product Direction

Eleven Realms is a seeded, turn-based, top-down exploration game about entering strange realms, reading a dangerous grid, recovering ancient objects, and deciding when to push deeper or escape.

The target is a premium indie-scale experience: authored atmosphere and memorable systems built on a deterministic, replayable foundation. The game should feel readable in a few seconds, but reveal deeper interactions over repeated runs.

## Reference DNA

These are design influences, not implementation requirements or imitation targets.

### The Legend of Zelda

- Visible objectives that lead the player through spaces.
- Keys, gates, tools, secrets, shortcuts, and environmental puzzles.
- A compact overworld that rewards curiosity and backtracking.
- Distinct landmarks that make navigation memorable.

### Into the Breach

- Every tile should communicate a meaningful tactical choice.
- Enemy intent, hazards, range, push, positioning, and terrain should be legible.
- Turns should be short, consequential, and reversible through good planning rather than hidden information.
- Encounters should be solvable puzzles, not damage sponges.

### Shiren the Wanderer

- Seeded expeditions with meaningful risk and imperfect information.
- Items, status effects, traps, enemies, and emergent stories.
- Runs should be interesting even when they end early.
- The seed, route, decisions, and discoveries should make each run shareable.

### A Dark Room

- Sparse interface with strong feedback.
- Discovery before explanation.
- A world that expands from one quiet starting point.
- Small resources and logs that imply a larger story.

### Early Dragon Quest

- Clear overworld progression and simple readable movement.
- Towns, dungeons, quests, equipment, and escalating threats.
- A warm contrast between ordinary travel and strange places.
- Progression that is understandable without a wiki.

## Core Player Loop

1. Enter a seeded realm.
2. Read the immediate objective and visible terrain.
3. Explore rooms and connected regions.
4. Collect resources, keys, relics, and clues.
5. Read enemy intent and resolve tactical encounters.
6. Choose a route, optional objective, faction, or risk.
7. Unlock the next gate or defeat the realm guardian.
8. Leave with a run summary, discoveries, and persistent unlock progress.
9. Start another run with a new seed, challenge, or build.

### Phase 4: Premium Indie Polish

## Design Guardrails

- A new system must create a decision, discovery, or story consequence.
- Prefer visible rules over hidden math.
- Prefer a small number of expressive items over a large loot table.
- Avoid procedural noise that does not create meaningful route choices.
- Every hazard must have a readable warning or learnable tell.
- Every boss attack must be explainable from the board state.
- The player should understand defeat and know what to try next.
- New content must preserve deterministic replay for the same seed and ruleset.
- Do not add live-service pressure, energy timers, or monetization loops to the core game.

## Success Criteria

A strong first public demo should let a new player:

- understand movement within thirty seconds,
- reach a meaningful choice within two minutes,
- discover at least one secret or optional reward,
- understand why a mistake happened,
- complete or lose one compact realm in ten to fifteen minutes,
- replay the same seed and make a better decision,
- finish with a memorable image, rule, character, or unresolved mystery.
